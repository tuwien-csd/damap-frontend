# Theming in Damap

## Custom theme

In case you want to adapt the theme (f.e. use your institutional colors) you can make those changes
in `custom-theme.scss` and `custom-palettes.scss`.

Please make sure to never merge those changes back into the main repository.

More information on theming can be found [here](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming).

## Logo

Please provide your logo as `logo.svg` under `src/assets`.
